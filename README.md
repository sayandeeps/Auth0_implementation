Run the following command in the same folder as the index.html file you created earlier:
```
npm init -y

npm init -y
npm install express
npm install -D nodemon
```
Finally, open the package.json file and modify the "scripts" entry to look like the following
```
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon server.js"
  },
  // ...
}
```
